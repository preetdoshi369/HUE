            <p>
                Harsha & Rakesh Salon & Academy is a premier destination for beauty and grooming located in Mumbai Suburbs  
                with a commitment to providing exceptional services in hair, beauty, and skincare. Onboarded in 2018, the salon
                 has experienced significant growth, expanding from four outlets to ten in just six years. Known for its beautifully 
                 designed interiors created by leading interior designers, the salon aims to offer a luxurious experience to its
                  clientele. Despite its growth and a loyal customer base, the salon faces challenges in establishing a strong 
                  brand presence in a competitive market populated by well-known names like Enrich Salons, Envi Salons, and Geetanjali
                   Salons. Additionally, their academy is striving for recognition comparable to that of Vikas Marwah and other esteemed academies.

                <h6>Brand Presence:</h6>
                <p> Brand Presence: Despite expanding to ten locations, Harsha & Rakesh Salon & Academy struggles to achieve a brand presence that rivals established competitors.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Internal Branding:</h6>
                <p> While the salons have stunning decor, internal branding lacks consistency, which is crucial for enhancing overall brand image.

              <li>
